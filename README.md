## Components

### Hadoop Ecosystem

- **HDFS**: Distributed file system for storing large data sets.
- **Yarn**: Resource management for Hadoop.
- **Hive**: Data warehouse software for querying and managing large datasets.
- **Spark**: Fast and general-purpose cluster-computing system.

### Container Orchestration

- **Kubernetes**: Automates deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

### Automation

- **Ansible**: Automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
- **Terraform**: Provides infrastructure as code.

### Security

- **Kerberos**: Network authentication protocol.
- **Apache Ranger**: Provides security and access control.

### Data Management

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing unstructured patient data.
- **AWS S3**: Scalable object storage for data.
### Data Processing

Data is processed and stored using:
Hadoop Ecosystem: HDFS, Yarn, Hive, Spark.
MongoDB: For unstructured patient data.
AWS S3: For large-scale data storage.

### Workflow Orchestration

- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates complex computational workflows.
### Compliance
Ensures compliance with healthcare data regulations such as HIPAA.
