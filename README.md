# AWS-Driven Big Data Infrastructure for Healthcare with Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible

Overview
This project showcases an automated, scalable big data infrastructure designed for processing healthcare data on AWS. By integrating Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible, this infrastructure is capable of managing and processing large datasets with high efficiency, reliability, and security.

Key Components
Terraform: Used to define and provision the AWS infrastructure as code, including VPC, RDS, EMR, and EC2 instances. Terraform ensures that the infrastructure is consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled.

Jenkins: Serves as the CI/CD pipeline tool to automate the deployment process and manage the data processing workflows. Jenkins facilitates the seamless integration of code changes and infrastructure updates.

Ansible: Employed for configuration management and automation, particularly in setting up Jenkins on EC2 instances and configuring CloudWatch monitoring. Ansible ensures that the systems are correctly configured and operational.

AWS Services Utilized
Amazon RDS: A managed relational database service used to store structured healthcare data with high availability and security.

Amazon EMR: A cloud-native big data platform used to process and analyze large datasets using Apache Spark. EMR allows for scalable and fast data processing.

Amazon EC2: Virtual servers in the cloud used to host the Jenkins server and other necessary components of the infrastructure.

Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor the health of the infrastructure and applications.

Project Structure
Ansible Directory:

Contains playbooks for automating the setup of Jenkins and CloudWatch monitoring.
Terraform Directory:

Holds the Terraform configuration files that define the AWS infrastructure.
Scripts Directory:

Includes Python scripts for data extraction, processing using Spark, and validation.
Jenkins Pipeline:

Automates the deployment of infrastructure and the execution of data workflows, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
Features
Scalable and Secure Infrastructure:

The infrastructure is built to handle large-scale data processing tasks while ensuring the security and integrity of sensitive healthcare data.
Automation:

Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of the infrastructure, reducing manual effort and the risk of human error.
Big Data Processing:

Utilizes Apache Spark on EMR for fast and efficient processing of large datasets, making it suitable for various data analytics and machine learning tasks.
Monitoring and Observability:

CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring of infrastructure health and performance, allowing for proactive management and troubleshooting.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining Terraform, Jenkins, and Ansible to build and manage a robust big data infrastructure on AWS. It is ideal for processing healthcare data, ensuring that the infrastructure is scalable, secure, and capable of handling complex data processing tasks with ease.
